* My feeds
This repo contains my personal RSS/Atom feeds and a minimal
environment for the automatic deploy to an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML][OPML file]].
You can download it in the releases page of this repository i.e. [[https://github.com/aciceri/feeds/releases][here]].

I use [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] and [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]] to manage my collection and to export the
OPML file.
The [[feeds.org]] file contains hierarchically the different feeds.

* Automatic deploying
The automatic deploying is done by [[https://travis-ci.org/github/aciceri/feeds/][travis]] which install an Emacs
version with the last versions of elfeed and elfeed-org packages from
MELPA using a Nix derivation that can be found in [[default.nix]] and then
runs the [[export.el]] script.
Then travis is delegated to tag the commit and release the OPML file.
